## The system is addressing the below problems:

1. Water Solution: Participants can develop a solution to locate the nearest clean water source.

2. Water Solution: Participants can create a solution that can locate the nearest water treatment facility.

## The solutions we are giving:

Wabayetu is a Mobile based Application designed by Wabayetu developers to solve the
problem of water insecurities in modern Africa in relation to technology.
Wabayetu came as a result of strong and persistent droughts that are experienced largely
within Africa.
This Application focuses on providing a point to point cover of all water kiosks, factories
around consumers and provide the necessary connection. This is made possible by the
integration of Google Maps within the Application, nearest water kiosks are located within the
minimum time possible. Being just the beginning Wabayetu will look to partner with different
companies to facilitate the operation by running ads on the app, the ads will just be within the
context of Water Insecurities.
Wabayetu App also seek to implement user education through the app, Users are able to get
tutorials on water conservation criteria such as use of rain barrels to collect rain water and
many other techniques . This is made possible by the integration of weather focus within the
application, users are made aware of the future occurrence of rain, through this they’re able
to get the necessary facilities for water conservation.
The App is also able to track user activities, all the kiosks visited by the user, their location
and the Amount of money used in purchasing the water.
The Last and Most Unique feature of Wabayetu is the provision of FAQ within the Application.
All question that are frequently asked by users and their solutions are recorded within the
Application.

## In short terms:
It is Platform where a registered user with a smartphone can be able to see nearby water treatment facility and kiosk in the map.
It still creates employment to the users with kiosk and water treatment facility hence increasing the employment in the country.
